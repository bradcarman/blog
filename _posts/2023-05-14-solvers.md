# Introduction
Most real life engineering problems do not construct well formed ODE's because almost inevitablly there will be algebraic constraints and this leads to having something called a `Mass Matrix`.  See (https://docs.sciml.ai/SciMLTutorialsOutput/html/advanced/02-advanced_ODE_solving.html)[SciML Tutorials] "Handling Mass Matricies" for a good explaination.
